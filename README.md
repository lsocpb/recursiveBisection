> 'Algorithms and Data Structures' Project.

## Description

As wikipedia says the bisection method is a root-finding method that applies to any continuous function for which one knows two values with opposite signs.

## Usage

```java

# instance of bisection class
Bisection b = new Bisection();

# returns a root of f(x) = x^2 - 1 for x1 = -1 and x2 = 5.
b.bisection(-1, 5)

```
